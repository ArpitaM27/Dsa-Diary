time complexity= rate at which time taken icreases with respect to inpits size
measured by big Oh notation
 O()
 inside bracket u write no of steps taken

 rules:-
 u take worse case scenario
 ignore constants
 avoid lower values

 theta= avg complexity
 omega=best case complexity

 space complexity=auxillary space+input space
